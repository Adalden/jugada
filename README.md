###Story

(thoughts?)

Our story starts with a boy named Hubert. He lives in a nice little town. They thrive on their economy of farming, fishing, and mining. Every year they have to give a tribute to the king. This year, Hubert is old enough to help out in preparing the tribute. You get to control Hubert as he helps his fellow villagers. Play as a messenger boy, fisherman, miner, farmer, and all-around good kid.
